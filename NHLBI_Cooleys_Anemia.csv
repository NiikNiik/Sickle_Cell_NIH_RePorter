We have developed a novel approach where we produce base edits in blood stemcells to both re-activate therapeutic fetal hemoglobin and create cells resistant to immune-based therapies.

Children inheriting faulty globin genes from both parents such as in thalassemiamajor/Cooleys anemia have severe anemia requiring monthly blood transfusions. While transfusions reducethe symptoms of thalassemia over time almost every patient experiences transfusion-induced iron overloadand life-threatening organ damage to the liver kidney heart and lungs among others. Thus thalassemiasyndromes represent a significant burden to healthcare resources in the United States and globally aspatients require extensive medical care throughout their lives. The Eleventh Cooley's Anemia Symposiumwhich will be held at The Cure in New York City NY USA on October 17  20 2022 is the preeminent forumfor convening scientists clinicians industry caregivers policy makers and patient support groups onresearch and treatment for thalassemia syndromes. Since the first joint symposium of the New York Academyof Sciences and the Cooleys Anemia Foundation in 1964 breakthrough research and early results of clinicaltrials shared at this conference (held approximately every 5  6 years) quickly become integrated by scientificresearchers and healthcare providers alike; thus expediting translation of new discoveries into possiblemedical treatments and successful clinical trials into approved therapies. The 2022 conference will bringtogether approximately 250 participants from around the world to discuss basics science research andemerging therapies using cutting-edge tools and treatments which may have the potential to curethalassemia.

Inheriteddisorders that affect the synthesis or structure of adult hemoglobin called b-thalassemia and sickle celldisease are common throughout the world and particularly in resource-poor countries in Africa and Asia.These disorders adversely affect well-being and survival of affected individuals and together constitute amajor global health challenge. Our work focuses on the control of expression of the fetal-type hemoglobin(HbF) which is expressed during fetal life and largely silent in the adult. A unique protein BCL11A silencesexpression of HbF and serves as a critical molecular switch. The goal of the project is to determine in detailhow BCL11A silences HbF as this knowledge forms the foundation for discovery of new drugs to reactivateHbF in patients with the major hemoglobin disorders.,NHLBI,10164842,4/30/2021,PA-18-484,5R01HL032259-38,5,R01,HL,32259,38,,"QASBA, PANKAJ ",4/1/1982,4/30/2023,Molecular and Cellular Hematology Study Section[MCH], ,1862884,"ORKIN, STUART H",Not Applicable,7,Unavailable,76593722,Z1L9F1MM1RY3,76593722,Z1L9F1MM1RY3,US,42.337481,-71.104964,1504801,BOSTON CHILDREN'S HOSPITAL,BOSTON,MA,Independent Hospitals,21155724,UNITED STATES,N,5/1/2021,4/30/2022, ,839,Non-SBIR/STTR,2021,442500, ,NHLBI,250000,192500, ,442500

Orkin,NarrativePrior to birth the principal hemoglobin in our red blood cells is fetal hemoglobin (HbF) whereas after birththe major hemoglobin is an adult type designated HbA. The genetic diseases sickle cell disease (SCD)and -thalassemia (Cooley's anemia) are among the most prevalent genetic conditions and affect severalmillion individuals worldwide. It is well established that HbF is able to replace HbA and ameliorate theseverity of the hemoglobin disorders. Therefore a major goal of our research is to develop methods toreactivate HbF in adults for therapy.

Orkin,NarrativePrior to birth the principal hemoglobin in our red blood cells is fetal hemoglobin (HbF) whereas after birththe major hemoglobin is an adult type designated HbA. The genetic diseases sickle cell disease (SCD)and -thalassemia (Cooley's anemia) are among the most prevalent genetic conditions and affect severalmillion individuals worldwide. It is well established that HbF is able to replace HbA and ameliorate theseverity of the hemoglobin disorders. Therefore a major goal of our research is to develop methods toreactivate HbF in adults for therapy.

Inherited disorders that affect either the synthesis or structure of adult hemoglobin the -thalassemias and sickle cell anemia respectively are among the most common diseases worldwide. Our work is directed toward understanding how the red blood cell is programmed to express different types of hemoglobin at different times of development. Reactivation of a fetal form of hemoglobin (HbF) greatly ameliorates the consequences of the hemoglobin diseases. The work proposed in this application directly addresses how HbF is normally silenced in development by a specific protein known as BCL11A. This protein serves as the critical molecular switch in this process.

The goal of this Phase I project is to identify small molecule drug-like compounds to a unique transcription factor that regulates the levels of HbF. Our long-term goal is development of a small molecule oral medication to treat these very serious inherited -globin disorders.,NHLBI,9128707,7/25/2016,PA-14-071,5R43HL124897-02,5,R43,HL,124897,2,,"WARREN, RONALD Q",9/1/2015,7/31/2017,Special Emphasis Panel[ZRG1-VH-F(10)B], ,8021796,"THACHER, SCOTT MCNEAR",Not Applicable,50,Unavailable,103462128,GNYKMU6R4H64,103462128,GNYKMU6R4H64,US,32.911713,-117.232045,4544601,ORPHAGEN PHARMACEUTICALS,SAN DIEGO,CA,Domestic For-Profits,921211312,UNITED STATES,N,8/1/2016,7/31/2017, ,839,SBIR/STTR,2016,160677, ,NHLBI,107261,42904, ,160677

Inherited disorders that affect either the synthesis or structure of adult hemoglobin the -thalassemias and sickle cell anemia respectively are among the most common diseases worldwide. Our work is directed toward understanding how the red blood cell is programmed to express different types of hemoglobin at different times of development. Reactivation of a fetal form of hemoglobin (HbF) greatly ameliorates the consequences of the hemoglobin diseases. The work proposed in this application directly addresses how HbF is normally silenced in development by a specific protein known as BCL11A. This protein serves as the critical molecular switch in this process. By understanding how BCL11A accomplishes its task we will be in a favorable position to develop specific inhibitors as new therapeutics for reactivating HbF in patients.,NHLBI,9037696,4/28/2016,PA-11-260,5R01HL032259-34,5,R01,HL,32259,34,,"QASBA, PANKAJ ",4/1/1982,4/30/2018,Molecular and Cellular Hematology Study Section[MCH], ,1862884,"ORKIN, STUART H",Not Applicable,7,Unavailable,76593722,Z1L9F1MM1RY3,76593722,Z1L9F1MM1RY3,US,42.337481,-71.104964,1504801,BOSTON CHILDREN'S HOSPITAL,BOSTON,MA,Independent Hospitals,21155724,UNITED STATES,N,5/1/2016,4/30/2017, ,839,Non-SBIR/STTR,2016,442500, ,NHLBI,250000,192500, ,442500

Inherited mutations to these genes can cause chronic anemia bony deformities reduction in pediatric growth and other complications. Children inheriting faulty globin genes from both parents such as in thalassemia major/Cooley's anemia have severe anemia requiring monthly blood transfusions. While transfusions reduce the symptoms of thalassemia over time almost every patient experiences transfusion- induced iron overload and life-threatening organ damage to the liver kidney heart and lungs among others. Thus thalassemia syndromes represent a significant burden to healthcare resources in the United States and globally as patients require extensive medical care throughout their lives. The Tenth Cooley's Anemia Symposium which will be held at Loews Chicago O'Hare Hotel on October 18 - 22 2015 is the preeminent forum for convening scientists clinicians industry caregivers policy makers and patient support groups on research and treatment for thalassemia syndromes.

Inherited disorders that affect either the synthesis or structure of adult hemoglobin the -thalassemias and sickle cell anemia respectively are among the most common diseases worldwide. Our work is directed toward understanding how the red blood cell is programmed to express different types of hemoglobin at different times of development. Reactivation of a fetal form of hemoglobin (HbF) greatly ameliorates the consequences of the hemoglobin diseases. The work proposed in this application directly addresses how HbF is normally silenced in development by a specific protein known as BCL11A. This protein serves as the critical molecular switch in this process. By understanding how BCL11A accomplishes its task we will be in a favorable position to develop specific inhibitors as new therapeutics for reactivating HbF in patients.,NHLBI,8923328,3/19/2015,PA-11-260,5R01HL032259-33,5,R01,HL,32259,33,,"QASBA, PANKAJ ",4/1/1982,4/30/2018,Molecular and Cellular Hematology Study Section[MCH], ,1862884,"ORKIN, STUART H",Not Applicable,7,Unavailable,76593722,Z1L9F1MM1RY3,76593722,Z1L9F1MM1RY3,US,42.337481,-71.104964,1504801,BOSTON CHILDREN'S HOSPITAL,BOSTON,MA,Independent Hospitals,21155724,UNITED STATES,N,5/1/2015,4/30/2016, ,839,Non-SBIR/STTR,2015,434631, ,NHLBI,246250,188381, ,434631

Annual medical costs exceed $1 billion. Elevation of fetal hemoglobin (HbF) is considered a highly promising approach to treat SCD or the -thalassemias since the effects of the defective or absent -globin chain can be overcome by induction of fetal -chain production. Safe and effective therapies that elevate HbF will be rapidly accepted. The goal of this Phase I project is to identify small molecule drug-like compounds to a unique transcription factor that regulates the levels of HbF. Our long-term goal is development of a small molecule oral medication to treat these very serious inherited -globin disorders.

Inherited disorders that affect either the synthesis or structure of adult hemoglobin the -thalassemias and sickle cell anemia respectively are among the most common diseases worldwide. Our work is directed toward understanding how the red blood cell is programmed to express different types of hemoglobin at different times of development. Reactivation of a fetal form of hemoglobin (HbF) greatly ameliorates the consequences of the hemoglobin diseases. The work proposed in this application directly addresses how HbF is normally silenced in development by a specific protein known as BCL11A. This protein serves as the critical molecular switch in this process. By understanding how BCL11A accomplishes its task we will be in a favorable position to develop specific inhibitors as new therapeutics for reactivating HbF in patients.,NHLBI,8694451,9/8/2014,PA-11-260,2R01HL032259-32,2,R01,HL,32259,32,,"QASBA, PANKAJ ",4/1/1982,4/30/2018,Molecular and Cellular Hematology Study Section[MCH], ,1862884,"ORKIN, STUART H",Not Applicable,7,Unavailable,76593722,Z1L9F1MM1RY3,76593722,Z1L9F1MM1RY3,US,42.337481,-71.104964,1504801,BOSTON CHILDREN'S HOSPITAL,BOSTON,MA,Independent Hospitals,21155724,UNITED STATES,N,9/15/2014,4/30/2015, ,839,Non-SBIR/STTR,2014,438750, ,NHLBI,250000,188750, ,438750

There are over 200 known disease-associated mutationsin the beta-globin gene. Through various molecular mechanisms (e.g. premature stop codons) thesemutations affect the protein product yielding the disease phenotype. One potential approach for the treatmentof beta-thalassemia is the introduction of non-mutant mRNAs through gene therapy (lentivirus). Promisingresults in animal models have shown that it is possible to rescue beta-globin knock-out mice using theseapproaches. However when this approach is translated to the clinic only a certain subset of the patientsrespond to the treatment. We hypothesize that it is the presence of long-lived mutant mRNAs thatcompete with the viral mRNA for the translational machinery that reduces the effectiveness of thetherapeutic approach. With this model based on the genotype and analysis of the mRNA stability we aim topredict the potential success of gene therapy given a specific mutation.,NHLBI,8644131,3/15/2014,PA-07-070,5R01HL102449-05,5,R01,HL,102449,5,,"QASBA, PANKAJ ",4/5/2010,3/31/2015,Erythrocyte and Leukocyte Biology Study Section[ELB], ,7368185,"RIVELLA, STEFANO ",Not Applicable,12,PEDIATRICS,60217502,YNT8TCJH8FQ8,60217502,YNT8TCJH8FQ8,US,40.7607,-73.9603,1514803,WEILL MEDICAL COLL OF CORNELL UNIV,NEW YORK,NY,SCHOOLS OF MEDICINE,100654805,UNITED STATES,N,4/1/2014,3/31/2015, ,839,Non-SBIR/STTR,2014,409910, ,NHLBI,242550,167360, ,409910

However the cure rate using bone marrow transplant is decreased in patients who have received transfusions as part of their therapy which is required for most of the above diseases. This grant proposes to study the mechanisms by which transfusion of platelets induces rejection of bone marrow transplantation; understanding these mechanisms will provide a rational basis to increasing cure rates using bone marrow transplantation and thus stands to benefit all individuals with the listed and related diseases.       ,NHLBI,8601877,12/24/2013,PAR-10-034,5R01HL105613-05,5,R01,HL,105613,5,,"MONDORO, TRACI ",1/1/2011,12/31/2015,Special Emphasis Panel[ZRG1-VH-E(50)R], ,2098815,"ZIMRING, JAMES C.",Not Applicable,7,Unavailable,92881085,ZN56PFWUDQK7,92881085,ZN56PFWUDQK7,US,47.608454,-122.326344,4265501,BLOODWORKS,SEATTLE,WA,Research Institutes,981041239,UNITED STATES,N,1/1/2014,12/31/2014, ,839,Non-SBIR/STTR,2014,458150, ,NHLBI,245000,213150, ,458150

However the cure rate using bone marrow transplant is decreased in patients who have received transfusions as part of their therapy which is required for most of the above diseases. This grant proposes to study the mechanisms by which transfusion of platelets induces rejection of bone marrow transplantation; understanding these mechanisms will provide a rational basis to increasing cure rates using bone marrow transplantation and thus stands to benefit all individuals with the listed and related diseases.       ,NHLBI,8529168,8/20/2012,PAR-10-034,7R01HL105613-03,7,R01,HL,105613,3,,"MONDORO, TRACI ",1/1/2011,12/31/2015,Special Emphasis Panel[ZRG1-VH-E(50)R], ,2098815,"ZIMRING, JAMES C.",Not Applicable,7,Unavailable,92881085,ZN56PFWUDQK7,92881085,ZN56PFWUDQK7,US,47.608454,-122.326344,4265501,BLOODWORKS,SEATTLE,WA,Research Institutes,981041239,UNITED STATES,N,9/1/2012,12/31/2012, ,839,Non-SBIR/STTR,2012,228045, ,NHLBI,147126,80919, ,228045

A complete description of the mechanism responsible for the regulation of gamma-globin gene expression would be important in the design of future pharmacological and molecular therapies to increase HbF. DNA methylation is a key factor in the regulation of gamma-globin gene expression. The experiments described in this proposal seek to understand the role of 5-hydroxymethylcytosine in the mechanism(s) responsible for DNA demethylation of the gamma-globin promoter during fetal liver erythropoiesis. It is our long term goal to understand the mechanism responsible for developmental regulation of the globin gene expression as a means to developing therapies for sickle cell disease and beta-thalassemia. We expect that our studies will foster the development of new strategies targeting the normal physiological mechanism responsible for gamma-globin gene DNA demethylation to achieve increased fetal hemoglobin levels in patients.          ,NHLBI,8525432,6/11/2013,PA-09-255,5R01HL114561-02,5,R01,HL,114561,2,,"QASBA, PANKAJ ",8/15/2012,5/31/2016,Molecular and Cellular Hematology Study Section[MCH], ,1970964,"LAVELLE, DONALD ",Not Applicable,7,INTERNAL MEDICINE/MEDICINE,98987217,W8XEAJDKMXH3,98987217,W8XEAJDKMXH3,US,41.871509,-87.667721,577703,UNIVERSITY OF ILLINOIS AT CHICAGO,Chicago,IL,SCHOOLS OF MEDICINE,606124305,UNITED STATES,N,6/1/2013,5/31/2014, ,839,Non-SBIR/STTR,2013,379610, ,NHLBI,238000,141610, ,379610

Few treatments exist to alleviate the symptoms of hemoglobinopathies and none are approved for children. Sickle cell anemia and beta-thalassemia remain an unmet medical need and a large public health burden. This project aims to generate an inhibitor of histone deacetylase 1 and 2 as a new therapeutic for these hemoglobinopathies.

There are over 200 known disease-associated mutationsin the beta-globin gene. Through various molecular mechanisms (e.g. premature stop codons) thesemutations affect the protein product yielding the disease phenotype. One potential approach for the treatmentof beta-thalassemia is the introduction of non-mutant mRNAs through gene therapy (lentivirus). Promisingresults in animal models have shown that it is possible to rescue beta-globin knock-out mice using theseapproaches. However when this approach is translated to the clinic only a certain subset of the patientsrespond to the treatment. We hypothesize that it is the presence of long-lived mutant mRNAs thatcompete with the viral mRNA for the translational machinery that reduces the effectiveness of thetherapeutic approach. With this model based on the genotype and analysis of the mRNA stability we aim topredict the potential success of gene therapy given a specific mutation.,NHLBI,8441629,4/1/2013,PA-07-070,5R01HL102449-04,5,R01,HL,102449,4,,"GOLDSMITH, JONATHAN C",4/5/2010,3/31/2015,Erythrocyte and Leukocyte Biology Study Section[ELB], ,7368185,"RIVELLA, STEFANO ",Not Applicable,12,PEDIATRICS,60217502,YNT8TCJH8FQ8,60217502,YNT8TCJH8FQ8,US,40.7607,-73.9603,1514803,WEILL MEDICAL COLL OF CORNELL UNIV,NEW YORK,NY,SCHOOLS OF MEDICINE,100654805,UNITED STATES,N,4/1/2013,3/31/2014, ,839,Non-SBIR/STTR,2013,398198, ,NHLBI,235620,162578, ,398198

However the cure rate using bone marrow transplant is decreased in patients who have received transfusions as part of their therapy which is required for most of the above diseases. This grant proposes to study the mechanisms by which transfusion of platelets induces rejection of bone marrow transplantation; understanding these mechanisms will provide a rational basis to increasing cure rates using bone marrow transplantation and thus stands to benefit all individuals with the listed and related diseases.       ,NHLBI,8402587,12/31/2012,PAR-10-034,5R01HL105613-04,5,R01,HL,105613,4,,"MONDORO, TRACI ",1/1/2011,12/31/2015,Special Emphasis Panel[ZRG1-VH-E(50)R], ,2098815,"ZIMRING, JAMES C.",Not Applicable,7,Unavailable,92881085,ZN56PFWUDQK7,92881085,ZN56PFWUDQK7,US,47.608454,-122.326344,4265501,BLOODWORKS,SEATTLE,WA,Research Institutes,981041239,UNITED STATES,N,1/1/2013,12/31/2013, ,839,Non-SBIR/STTR,2013,445060, ,NHLBI,238000,207060, ,445060

A complete description of the mechanism responsible for the regulation of gamma-globin gene expression would be important in the design of future pharmacological and molecular therapies to increase HbF. DNA methylation is a key factor in the regulation of gamma-globin gene expression. The experiments described in this proposal seek to understand the role of 5-hydroxymethylcytosine in the mechanism(s) responsible for DNA demethylation of the gamma-globin promoter during fetal liver erythropoiesis. It is our long term goal to understand the mechanism responsible for developmental regulation of the globin gene expression as a means to developing therapies for sickle cell disease and beta-thalassemia. We expect that our studies will foster the development of new strategies targeting the normal physiological mechanism responsible for gamma-globin gene DNA demethylation to achieve increased fetal hemoglobin levels in patients.

Although chelators have greatly improved life- expectancy in thalassemia over the last three decades many patients have unsatisfactory cardiac and whole-body iron burdens and cardiac siderosis remains the leading cause of death in young adults with thalassemia in developed countries. The problem is refractory to approaches by randomized clinical trials not only for logistical and financial reasons but also the impossibility of using parenteral deferoxamine as a randomized comparator arm now that oral chelators are available worldwide. We therefore propose a Comparative Effectiveness Research approach which will be based on the ongoing Thalassemia Longitudinal Cohort study with addition of a large international site to the current multi-site multinational observational cohort. The R34 project will establish the infrastructure for a full CER trial and provide pilot data on feasibility and the analysis methods themselves.

Through various molecular mechanisms (e.g. premature stop codons) thesemutations affect the protein product yielding the disease phenotype. One potential approach for the treatmentof beta-thalassemia is the introduction of non-mutant mRNAs through gene therapy (lentivirus). Promisingresults in animal models have shown that it is possible to rescue beta-globin knock-out mice using theseapproaches. However when this approach is translated to the clinic only a certain subset of the patientsrespond to the treatment. We hypothesize that it is the presence of long-lived mutant mRNAs thatcompete with the viral mRNA for the translational machinery that reduces the effectiveness of thetherapeutic approach. With this model based on the genotype and analysis of the mRNA stability we aim topredict the potential success of gene therapy given a specific mutation.,NHLBI,8240460,3/8/2012,PA-07-070,5R01HL102449-03,5,R01,HL,102449,3,,"GOLDSMITH, JONATHAN C",4/5/2010,3/31/2015,Erythrocyte and Leukocyte Biology Study Section[ELB], ,7368185,"RIVELLA, STEFANO ",Not Applicable,12,PEDIATRICS,60217502,YNT8TCJH8FQ8,60217502,YNT8TCJH8FQ8,US,40.7607,-73.9603,1514803,WEILL MEDICAL COLL OF CORNELL UNIV,NEW YORK,NY,SCHOOLS OF MEDICINE,100654805,UNITED STATES,N,4/1/2012,3/31/2013, ,839,Non-SBIR/STTR,2012,418275, ,NHLBI,247500,170775, ,418275

Diseases of the erythroid lineage includethe major disorders of hemoglobin (the oxygen carrying protein red blood cells) known as sickle cell anemiaand the thalassemia syndromes. Our work is directed toward understanding how the red blood cell isprogrammed to express different types of hemoglobin at different times of development. Reactivation of a fetalform of hemoglobin (HbF) can ameliorate the consequences of sickle cell anemia and thalassemia. The workproposed in this application addresses directly how HbF is silenced normally in development by a specificprotein known as BCL11A.

Although chelators have greatly improved life- expectancy in thalassemia over the last three decades many patients have unsatisfactory cardiac and whole-body iron burdens and cardiac siderosis remains the leading cause of death in young adults with thalassemia in developed countries. The problem is refractory to approaches by randomized clinical trials not only for logistical and financial reasons but also the impossibility of using parenteral deferoxamine as a randomized comparator arm now that oral chelators are available worldwide. We therefore propose a Comparative Effectiveness Research approach which will be based on the ongoing Thalassemia Longitudinal Cohort study with addition of a large international site to the current multi-site multinational observational cohort. The R34 project will establish the infrastructure for a full CER trial and provide pilot data on feasibility and the analysis methods themselves. Thalassemia remains one of the most prevalent genetic conditions worldwide and the results of this project will lead directly to improved global research collaboration and improved individualized therapies.

There are over 200 known disease-associated mutationsin the beta-globin gene. Through various molecular mechanisms (e.g. premature stop codons) thesemutations affect the protein product yielding the disease phenotype. One potential approach for the treatmentof beta-thalassemia is the introduction of non-mutant mRNAs through gene therapy (lentivirus). Promisingresults in animal models have shown that it is possible to rescue beta-globin knock-out mice using theseapproaches. However when this approach is translated to the clinic only a certain subset of the patientsrespond to the treatment. We hypothesize that it is the presence of long-lived mutant mRNAs thatcompete with the viral mRNA for the translational machinery that reduces the effectiveness of thetherapeutic approach.

Diseases of the erythroid lineage includethe major disorders of hemoglobin (the oxygen carrying protein red blood cells) known as sickle cell anemiaand the thalassemia syndromes. Our work is directed toward understanding how the red blood cell isprogrammed to express different types of hemoglobin at different times of development. Reactivation of a fetalform of hemoglobin (HbF) can ameliorate the consequences of sickle cell anemia and thalassemia. The workproposed in this application addresses directly how HbF is silenced normally in development by a specificprotein known as BCL11A.

We will systematically analyze the mechanisms underlying this effect in order to create a foundation for further testing of transferrin. The treatment for Beta-thalassemia is suboptimal but has remained unchanged for the past fifty years. Ultimately our goal is to provide an alternative treatment for these patients that could possibly be effective for other diseases associated with anemia and iron overload.

However the cure rate using bone marrow transplant is decreased in patients who have received transfusions as part of their therapy which is required for most of the above diseases. This grant proposes to study the mechanisms by which transfusion of platelets induces rejection of bone marrow transplantation; understanding these mechanisms will provide a rational basis to increasing cure rates using bone marrow transplantation and thus stands to benefit all individuals with the listed and related diseases.

Reactivation of a fetalform of hemoglobin (HbF) can ameliorate the consequences of sickle cell anemia and thalassemia.

There are over 200 known disease-associated mutationsin the beta-globin gene. Through various molecular mechanisms (e.g. premature stop codons) thesemutations affect the protein product yielding the disease phenotype. One potential approach for the treatmentof beta-thalassemia is the introduction of non-mutant mRNAs through gene therapy (lentivirus). Promisingresults in animal models have shown that it is possible to rescue beta-globin knock-out mice using theseapproaches. However when this approach is translated to the clinic only a certain subset of the patientsrespond to the treatment. We hypothesize that it is the presence of long-lived mutant mRNAs thatcompete with the viral mRNA for the translational machinery that reduces the effectiveness of thetherapeutic approach. With this model based on the genotype and analysis of the mRNA stability we aim topredict the potential success of gene therapy given a specific mutation.,NHLBI,7866331,4/5/2010,PA-07-070,1R01HL102449-01,1,R01,HL,102449,1,,"GOLDSMITH, JONATHAN C",4/5/2010,3/31/2015,Erythrocyte and Leukocyte Biology Study Section[ELB], ,7368185,"RIVELLA, STEFANO ",Not Applicable,12,PEDIATRICS,60217502,YNT8TCJH8FQ8,60217502,YNT8TCJH8FQ8,US,40.7607,-73.9603,1514803,WEILL MEDICAL COLL OF CORNELL UNIV,NEW YORK,NY,SCHOOLS OF MEDICINE,100654805,UNITED STATES,N,4/5/2010,3/31/2011, ,839,Non-SBIR/STTR,2010,422500, ,NHLBI,250000,172500, ,422500

Grant Title (if the title has changed)The title has not changed.2. Revised Abstract SectionThe hemoglobinopathies comprise the most prevalent class of human genetic diseases. Thoseinvolving the -globin locus include -thalassemia and sickle cell disease (SCD). A variety ofobservations and experimental results indicate that strategies designed to increase levels offetal hemoglobin in the erythrocytes of people with these diseases will produce significantclinical benefits. However none of the currently available strategies offer the combination ofsafety efficacy and convenience of use that would make them applicable to most patientsworldwide. Recent success in the development of targeted pharmacologic agents for thetreatment of a wide variety of human cancers attests to the ability of this approach to producedrugs with improved efficacy and decreased side effects. This strategy has the potential toproduce more effective agents for the pharmacologic induction of HbF. A prerequisite for therational development of such drugs is a thorough knowledge of the pathways involved in theregulation of HbF production. Despite more than three decades of research the underlyingmolecular mechanisms that regulate -globin gene expression and HbF production during adulterythroid differentiation and in response to HbF inducing agents remain poorly understood.Based on progress made during the previous funding period of this project we have published anovel mechanistic theory based on cell stress signaling to explain the action of fetal Hbinducing agents. If correct this model will unify most HbF inducing agents under a commonmechanism of action and will provide new molecular targets and an overall framework for thedevelopment of improved agents for HbF induction. In this application we propose anexperimental plan to test our hypothesis and to begin to pre-clinical development of moreeffective HbF inducing drugs for people with SCD and -thalassemia.3. Revised Specific Aims SectionThe following aims have been revised so that the proposed work can be completedduring the two-year funding period. In addition we have specifically focused on aims andmethods that will have the best chance for identifying and verifying novel targets forinduction of fetal hemoglobin in patients. The new aims take into account progress thathas been made since the original submission and reflect re-budgeting that will allowhiring of one additional laboratory researcher to achieve maximal progress during thefunding period.A. SPECIFIC AIMSLONG-TERM GOAL: To determine the underlying signaling pathways by which knowninducers of fetal hemoglobin act and to then use this information to develop safe andeffective medications that target these pathways to achieve clinically effective inductionof fetal Hb in SCD and -thalassemia patients worldwide.REVISED SPECIFIC AIMSAIM 1: To characterize the role of p38 MAPK pathway signaling in HbF induction.AIM 1A: To determine whether environmental stresses that activate p38 signaling (X-irradiationUV irradiation heat shock) will activate -globin gene expression and HbF production.AIM 1B: To determine whether p38 MAPK is necessary for -globin mRNA and HbF inductionAIM 1C: To determine whether knock-down of dual-specificity MAPK Thr/Tyr phosphatases(DUSPs) will independently up-regulate -globin gene expression and HbF production inhumanprimary erythroid cells.AIM 2: To determine whether the Integrated Stress Response signaling pathway isresponsible for the post-transcriptional components of HbF induction.AIM 2A: To determine whether EIF2A activation is required for increased production of HbF inresponse to inducing agents in human primary erythroid cells.AIM 2B: To determine whether knock-down of GADD34 protein levels will augment HbFinduction in human primary erythroid cells.AIM 3: To test the hypothesis that activating the NRF2/Antioxidant Stress Responsesignaling pathway will induce HbF production in human erythroid cells.AIM 3A: To determine whether agents that activate the NRF2/ARE signaling pathway willinduce -globin gene expression and HbF production in human erythroid cells (We now knowthey do).AIM 3B: To determine the mechanism of action by which activators of the NRF2/ARE pathwayincrease -globin gene expression and HbF production and to perform pre-clinical testing inhuman primary erythroid cells.4. Revised Public Health Relevance SectionThe only currently available therapy that targets the underlying causes of the -hemoglobinopathies is bone marrow transplantation. However due to a lack of suitable donorsavailability of this procedure at only a few centers worldwide and insufficient financial resourcesonly a very small fraction of patients are able to receive this treatment. The goal of our researchis to develop safe effective affordable and widely applicable therapies for sickle cell diseasebeta-thalassemia and related blood diseases based on the pharmacologic induction of fetalhemoglobin.,NHLBI,7665640,6/1/2009,PA-07-070,2R01HL073442-05A2,2,R01,HL,73442,5,A2,"QASBA, PANKAJ ",7/1/2009,6/30/2011,Erythrocyte and Leukocyte Biology Study Section[ELB], ,6666257,"LOWREY, CHRISTOPHER H.",Not Applicable,2,INTERNAL MEDICINE/MEDICINE,41027822,EB8ASJBCFER9,41027822,EB8ASJBCFER9,US,43.711386,-72.270611,2021601,DARTMOUTH COLLEGE,HANOVER,NH,SCHOOLS OF MEDICINE,37551421,UNITED STATES,Y,7/1/2009,6/30/2010, ,701,Non-SBIR/STTR,2009,395000, ,NHLBI,250000,145000, ,395000

Future therapeutic advances arelikely to require new treatment paradigms based upon innovative molecular strategies. The current proposaldescribes one new approach in which processes that regulate the stability and translational efficiency of globinmRNAs are manipulated to therapeutic advantage. This strategy is particularly attractive because it can beapplied to augment the effectiveness of existing therapies including gene-reactivation and gene-replacementapproaches.,NHLBI,7580203,2/11/2009,PA-07-070,2R01HL061399-10A1,2,R01,HL,61399,10,A1,"QASBA, PANKAJ ",4/1/1999,12/31/2012,Erythrocyte and Leukocyte Biology Study Section[ELB], ,1876421,"RUSSELL, J ERIC",Not Applicable,3,INTERNAL MEDICINE/MEDICINE,42250712,GM1XX56LEP58,42250712,GM1XX56LEP58,US,39.953462,-75.193983,6463801,UNIVERSITY OF PENNSYLVANIA,PHILADELPHIA,PA,SCHOOLS OF MEDICINE,191046205,UNITED STATES,N,2/11/2009,12/31/2009, ,839,Non-SBIR/STTR,2009,393750, ,NHLBI,250000,143750, ,393750
