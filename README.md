# Sickle_Cell_NIH_RePorter

This repository explores NIH RePORTER awards related to the Cure Sickle Cell Initiative. The `Sickle_Cell_initiative.ipynb` notebook keeps the workflow beginner-friendly: it cleans the data, compares sickle cell vs. Cooley's anemia spending, and uses one simple text model for practice.
